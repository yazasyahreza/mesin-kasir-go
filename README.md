As part of my final internship, I worked as a Junior Backend Developer to build a store application API using Go (Golang) and MySQL.
The API supports:

- CRUD operations for goods and employees
- Sales transaction processing
- Viewing transaction history

This project focused on implementing efficient backend logic, structuring endpoints, and ensuring smooth database communication through RESTful design.
